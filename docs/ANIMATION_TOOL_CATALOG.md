# TRIPPEDD Animation Tool Catalog

Free/open-source/public-domain/free-API ANIMATION tooling for production use.
Owner directive 2026-10-07: "pull in like thousands of open source tools that'll help with animation" — lip-sync first (syllables/vowels for mouths), then dialogue-to-animation timing, 2D animation, tweening/rigging, frame interpolation, storyboarding/animatics, compositing, episode-building utilities.
Owner EXPANSION 2026-10-07: the pull covers EVERYTHING needed for a whole animated show — full production pipeline: transitions, background/plate art, color grading, editing, title-card/motion-graphics, sound design/SFX libraries, music beds, dialogue editing, final encode/delivery.

**Counting rule:** the honest count is the number of `####` headings in this file.
**Badges:** ✅ commercial-safe · ⚠️ NC/restricted/verify-per-use · ❓ unverified · 🚫 excluded (documented why).
Every license verified from upstream sources, never assumed. GPL/AGPL family → [ANIMATION_QUARANTINE.md](ANIMATION_QUARANTINE.md), never wired into shipping paths until a license audit clears it.
